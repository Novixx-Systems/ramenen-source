# Ramenen Source Code

Yes, Ramenen is open source now.

Building requires L+++, which is in the UTILS folder, just copy UTILS\Novixx directory to the root of your C drive.


If you are going to create a new L+++ source file, use the LLL extension.

If you are going to create a new Assembly source file, use the ASM extension.
